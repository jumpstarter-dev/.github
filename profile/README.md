# ⚡ Jumpstarter – Hardware at the Speed of Software

## Why Jumpstarter?

Jumpstarter is a free and open-source Hardware-in-the-Loop (HiL) automation tool that bridges the gap between embedded development workflows and real-world deployment environments. It enables consistent and automated testing of your software stack across both **physical hardware** and **virtual targets**, using **cloud-native principles** like Kubernetes, declarative APIs, and GitOps.

Jumpstarter makes embedded system testing scalable, programmable, and CI/CD-friendly.

## What Can I Do with Jumpstarter?

- 🧪 Automate testing across physical and virtual devices under test (DUTs)
- 🔌 Remotely control test interfaces like UART, CAN, SPI, GPIO, power, and USB
- 🧰 Use "exporters" to expose hardware interfaces to your CI environment
- 🔐 Securely lease and forward DUT interfaces to authorized clients via gRPC
- 🧪 Integrate with PyTest and other Python testing tools
- 📦 Provision virtual hardware devices (e.g. QEMU) on demand
